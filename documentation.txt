ADDRESS BOOK.

So this is a simple project where I built a digital address book.
You know, like the ones people used to have on paper, but now it’s on the computer. 
It’s meant to help you store and manage your contacts in a basic way. Nothing too fancy, 
just enough to keep track of names, phone numbers, and emails.

What it does:
View Contacts: You can look at all the contacts you’ve saved. Like, just scroll through and see everything.
Create a Contact: If you want to add someone new, you can just put in their name, phone number, and email. 
Simple stuff.
Search for Contacts: If you need to find someone, you can search by their name, phone number, or email. 
Whatever info you remember.
Edit Contacts: If a contact changes their phone number or email or whatever, you can go in and update it 
without a hassle.
Delete Contacts: If you want to get rid of someone’s contact info (maybe they changed numbers or you just don’t 
need them anymore), you can delete them.
How it works:
Create Contact: When adding someone, you gotta enter:

Name (only letters, no numbers or special characters).
Phone Number (only numbers, no spaces or dashes or anything weird).
Email (it needs to look like a real email, so it has to have the “@” symbol and a domain like "gmail.com").
Search Contact: When you search, you can pick whether you want to find someone by their name, phone number,
 or email. So if you don’t remember their name but you remember their number, it’s all good.

Edit Contact: To edit, you first search for the contact, and then you can change anything—name, phone number, 
or email. It’s pretty flexible.

Delete Contact: If you want to delete someone, it’s the same as searching first. Once you find them, 
you can delete their info from the book. Clean and simple.

Saving Contacts:
The cool part is that everything you do—creating, editing, or deleting—gets saved to a contact.txt file.
 So, even if you close the program and come back later, all your contacts are still there. 
 It’s like a permanent record, no worries about losing stuff.

*SPECIAL MENTION*
COLOR CODES
There are several color codes used in the program for the better user readability..
These color codes are defined as macros in the contact.h file and they are used throughout other files during 
succesful operation or any error message popping
These are used like (MACRO_NAME "our general printf statement" RESET);
MACRO_NAME is used to specity the color and RESET is used to reset to the original color(white).


*FILE INFORMATION*

MAIN.C

It is used for the main menu displaying which is used throughout the process and it has some
switchcases to calling several functions.

CONTACT.h

It is used to give all the declarations to every file it includes function prototypes, header files
, structures and macros.

CONTACT.C

It has all the main function definitons. The internal checking, validiations etc are done in this.

VALIDIATIONS.C

In this the part 1 dummy contacts and some internal validiations are defined for the better understanding 
and modularity of each section.


CONTACTS.txt

Here the contacts are stored where they by complying to the code's operation and they stand as a permanent storage
for the future reference of the contacts.
